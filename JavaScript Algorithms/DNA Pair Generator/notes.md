# DNA Pair Generator

## What I Learned
- For some reason it took me a while to click that I could just include both elements in the sub-array instead of trying to push them both in mannually
- This one was pretty simple if/else logic, especially once I just manually made the matching pairs

## My Solution
- For every one of the 4 letters I just used if else to iterate through the string and push the subarray into one main array
