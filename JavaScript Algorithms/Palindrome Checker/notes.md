# Palindrome Checker

## What I learned
-I learned how to use regex to clear non alpha-numberic values 
-I worked with regex using .test and .filter to extract only alphanumeric contents

## My Solution
-I used conditions inside my event listener to check for palidromes and empty strings
-Using classList('add') to display the result of a button press that had an input
-I used filter and .test with regex to ensure that only alphanumeric components were being tested in the string, and I converted the whole string to lowerCase in the funciton aswell
