# Book Organizer

## What I learned
- This forced me to further understand stacking high order functions aswell as really dialing in my understanding of .sort()
- I failed to recognize the patter of what is wanted me to return on the last instructions

## My Solution
- I used .sort and .findIndex stacked to output the correct index
- Used a ternerary to make sure to return the array length when no item was in the index
