# Falsy Remover

## What I Learned
- Although this lesson wasn't too difficult, it definitely reiforced my need to recognize when to pivot aswell as question requirments
- I kept thinking that I needed to delete items within the array and it never occured to me I could just return a completely new array

## My Solution
- I used an if statement to directly check the boolean value of the element that I iterated through it the array
- If the value was truthy, I pushed it into the new array.  Else i used to continue feature to move on to the next iteration
