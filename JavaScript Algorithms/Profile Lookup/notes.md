# Profile Lookup - Notes

## What I learned
- This taught me iterating through stlightly more complex structures to find the property I was looking for
- Using bracket notation to keep object lookups dynamic within the function
- Combining the for loop with if and if else statements to cycle between multiple solutions

## My Solution Strategy
- I used iteration to cycle through the array letting i be the index one at a time
- I used the && operator in my if statements to ensure a different response that was dependent on whether the property I was looking up existed or not
