# Book Organizer

## What I learned
- This lab taught be all about using callback function and high order function
- I learned how to work with .sort and utilize callback functions to refrence them later on in my code
- Working with high order functions to condense code down

## My Solution
- Create a callback function initially to be passed on later to .sort
- Use arrowhead function with .filter and . notation to lookup specific properties in the object
- Plug the callback function as the parameter of .sort to automatically iterate in ascending order
