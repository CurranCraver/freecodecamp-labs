# DNA Pair Generator

## What I Learned
- This time I implemented using objects to set characters as new properties in order to condense my code
- I also remembered to use continue when iterating through if statements because sometimes I forget that an element will run through both

## My Solution
- Using an object to change the character in a string and assign it a new value
- Iterate through all the characters in a string and use includes() in the condition to check for html character
