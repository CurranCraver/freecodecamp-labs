# Password Generator

## What I Learned
- Recalled my knowledge about math operators
- Pretty straightforward once I did a little testing

## My Solution
- Loop through the number of characters the password was to be then concatenate the password with a randomly indexed value of all the characters in the string
- Used Math.floor() to round to nearest whole int, Math.random * the length of all the characters to give all possible variations of the equation
