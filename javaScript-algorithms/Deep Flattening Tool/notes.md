# Deep Flattening Tool

## What I learned
- After having absolutely no clue on how to extract multiple nested arrays without .flat, I finally learned about recursion
- Recursion is where I call the same function within the function until the condition is met which is a great way to continue iteration many many times
- Pairing recursion with forEach and the spread operator was very powerful

## My Solution
- Use recursion with the spread operator to flatten the array repeatedly until there for no more nested sublayers within a for each
