# Symmetric Difference Function

## What I learned
- Fasted one I have done yet, very similar to the last problem so it means I really did learn!
- For some reason in my head I thought that I couldn't use .includes on array elements

## My Solution
- This time I learned from my mistakes by only using .filter with .includes to easily return true values
