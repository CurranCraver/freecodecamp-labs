## What I learned
- The main thing I look away from this was calling previous function inside current functions
- The functions themselves were not too difficult to solve, I just needed to figure out how to store and call the result from one function to the next

# My solution
- I called on a function inside another by assinging the previous function I needed to a variable and calling the function with the parameters that would be passed in
