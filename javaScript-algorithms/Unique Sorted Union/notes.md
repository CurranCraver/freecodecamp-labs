# Unique Sorted Union

## What I Learned
- I learned how to use variadic function to push all elements together
- Refirmed using multiple conditionals in my if statements to prevent unwanted elements from being pushed into my array.
- Worked with manipulation elements in the arrays as well as getting familiar with for of loops

## My Solution
- It took me a while but I finally realized that I could use a variadic function to pass in all the arrays together at once, which then let the rest of the iteration process be pretty straightforward.
