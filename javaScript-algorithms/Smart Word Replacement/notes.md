# Smart Word Replacement

## What I Learned
- I should have tried to optimize and further condense using capture groups
- I used regex to check if the first letter of a word was capitilized with conditions

## My Solution
- I check for caps using regex with an if statement
- I converted the first letter of the stirng toUpperCase if caps were found and toLowerCase elsewise
- I replaced instance of string2 with the newFound capital or uncapped version
